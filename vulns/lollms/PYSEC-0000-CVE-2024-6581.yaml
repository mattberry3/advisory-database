id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-6581
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: A vulnerability in the discussion image upload function of the Lollms application,
  version v9.9, allows for the uploading of SVG files. Due to incomplete filtering
  in the sanitize_svg function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities,
  which in turn pose a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg function only
  removes script elements and 'on*' event attributes, but does not account for other
  potential vectors for XSS within SVG files. This vulnerability can be exploited
  when authorized users access a malicious URL containing the crafted SVG file.
