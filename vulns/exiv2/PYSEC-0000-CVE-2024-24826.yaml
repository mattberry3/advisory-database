id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-24826
details: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2
  version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was
  new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds
  read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.
  In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed
  in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
