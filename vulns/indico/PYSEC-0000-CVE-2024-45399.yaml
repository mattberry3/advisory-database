id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-45399
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend
  authentication system for Flask. In Indico prior to version 3.3.4, corresponding
  to Flask-Multipass prior to version 0.5.5, there is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability
  during account creation when redirecting to the `next` URL. Exploitation requires
  initiating the account creation process with a maliciously crafted link, and then
  finalizing the signup process. Because of this, it can only target newly created
  (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. Indico 3.3.4 upgrades the dependency on Flask-Multipass
  to version 0.5.5, which fixes the issue. Those who build the Indico package themselves
  and cannot upgrade can update the `flask-multipass` dependency to `>=0.5.5` which
  fixes the vulnerability. Otherwise one could configure one's web server to disallow
  requests containing a query string with a `next` parameter that starts with `javascript:`.
