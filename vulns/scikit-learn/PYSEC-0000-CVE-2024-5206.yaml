id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-5206
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer,
  specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version
  1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage of all tokens present
  in the training data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing
  the subset of tokens required for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior
  leads to the potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attribute
  could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such as passwords
  or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on the nature of the data
  being processed by the vectorizer.
